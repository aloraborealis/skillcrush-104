			<h4>Who knew my name was a FONT?!?</h4>
			<p>Among other things,I have learned that my somewhat unusually spelled name was a coolmodern FONT...which gave me warm fuzzies.</p>

			<p>"Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction." -Skillcrush <br> Weeeelll...then, I must be doing the right thing,because Ihave spent a lot of time being confused, but the payoff has been worth it!</p>

			<h4>Tenacity and determination</h4>
			<p>NEW skills test your limits,and I have been so encouraged by the resources available online and by the cool stuff I have learned, each new victory has spurred me on.</p>
			<p>Employ the power of "YET"....as in,"I can't do this.....YET!"<br>YET is a powerful word.</p>

			<p>I am glad I am older, 43 years old, because I have lots of experience to help me remember that new things take time and work, and that it is almost always worth the effort.</p>

			<p>P.S. Get some sleep, eat something healthy, take a walk and a shower then sit all the way down and WORK.</p>
